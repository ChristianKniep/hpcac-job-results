The OpenFabrics (openib) BTL failed to initialize while trying to
allocate some locked memory.  This typically can indicate that the
memlock limits are set too low.  For most HPC installations, the
memlock limits should be set to "unlimited".  The failure occured
here:

  Local host:    venus002
  OMPI source:   btl_openib.c:886
  Function:      ompi_free_list_init_ex_new()
  Device:        mlx4_0
  Memlock limit: 1048576

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.  This FAQ entry on the Open MPI web site may also be
helpful:

At least one pair of MPI processes are unable to reach each other for
MPI communications.  This means that no Open MPI device has indicated
that it can be used to communicate between these processes.  This is
an error; Open MPI requires that all MPI processes be able to reach
each other.  This error can sometimes be the result of forgetting to
specify the "self" BTL.

  Process 1 ([[10577,1],15]) is on host: venus002
  Process 2 ([[10577,1],0]) is on host: venus002
  BTLs attempted: openib self

Your MPI job is now going to abort; sorry.

MPI_INIT has failed because at least one MPI process is unreachable
from another.  This *usually* means that an underlying communication
plugin -- such as a BTL or an MTL -- has either not loaded or not
allowed itself to be used.  Your MPI job will now abort.

You may wish to try to narrow down the problem;

 * Check the output of ompi_info to see which BTL/MTL plugins are
   available.
 * Run your application with MPI_THREAD_SINGLE.
 * Set the MCA parameter btl_base_verbose to 100 (or mtl_base_verbose,
   if using MTL-based communications) to see exactly which
   communication plugins were considered and/or discarded.

Primary job  terminated normally, but 1 process returned
a non-zero exit code.. Per user-direction, the job has been aborted.
-------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[10577,1],9]
  Exit code:    1
